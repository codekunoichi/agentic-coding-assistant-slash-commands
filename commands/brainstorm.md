# Brainstorming Session

Your task is NOT to solve this yet, but to help me think through possibilities and considerations.

## Topic to Explore
$ARGUMENTS

## Your responsibilities:

- Generate diverse ideas and approaches for this topic
- Consider multiple perspectives (technical, user, business, edge cases)
- Identify potential challenges or constraints I should consider
- Surface assumptions that might need validation
- Suggest questions I should be asking myself

## Guidelines:

- Think expansively first, then we can narrow down
- Don't assume constraints unless I've stated them
- Ask clarifying questions if the topic is ambiguous
- Organize ideas by theme or category where helpful

Remember, this is exploration - help me see angles I might be missing. After presenting initial thoughts, list any clarifying questions you have about scope, constraints, or goals.
